NAME
    Soar::Production::Printer - Print Soar productions

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use Soar::Production::Parser;
      use Soar::Production::Printer;
      use Data::Dumper;
  
      #read in a series of productions from a file
      my $parser = Soar::Production::Parser->new;
      my @trees=$parser->parse_file("foo.soar");
  
      #print each of the productions to standard out
      for my $prod(@trees){
            print tree_to_text($prod);
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to print production parse trees produced by
    Soar::Production::parser. Use the function "tree_to_text" to accomplish
    this.

    Printing is accomplished by traversing the input structure exactly as it
    is specified by the grammar used by Soar::Production::Parser.

NAME
    Soar::Production::pRINT - Perl extension for printing Soar productions

METHODS
  "tree_to_text"
    Argument: parse tree structured as those returned by
    Soar::Production::Parser. Returns a text representation of the
    production which can be sourced by Soar.

  TODO
    Pretty printing is not yet possible, which is too bad because it means
    the output can be pretty disgusting looking.
